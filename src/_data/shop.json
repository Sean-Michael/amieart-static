  "highlightText": "This shop features original, hand-printed clothing and accessories made using linoleum block printing. Each design is based on my own illustrations, which start as sketches and are carved and printed by hand.\nThe shop includes a range of designs—from playful characters to simple nature-inspired graphics. I print on shirts, totes, and paper using water-based inks and a mix of new, thrifted, or ethically sourced materials to keep production low-waste and sustainable.\n\nEvery item is printed individually, so slight variations are part of the process. If you're looking for unique, artist-made pieces with a focus on quality and sustainability, you’ll find that here. Thanks for supporting handmade art.\n",
