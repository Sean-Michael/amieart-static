  "highlightText": "I love coming up with new print ideas based on my paintings and drawings. I love the feeling that comes with knowing that people want to buy and enjoy my art as well as interacting with customers by answering questions, reading reviews, and discussing custom orders.\n\nAll of my prints start out as doodles in my sketchbook while passing the time while in class or at work. I then transfer those sketches to linoleum and start carving away at the design. I print will take anywhere from 2-12 hours start to finish. I decide what shirt/bag/paper color the print will go on and develop the listing. I use my self timer or my wonderful friends to help model the finished products before posting the listing for sale.",
