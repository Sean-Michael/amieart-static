  "statement": "blah blah blah \n\nMy work investigates the shifting boundaries between the natural and artificial worlds. I am interested in how our increasingly digital existence transforms our relationship with organic forms and natural processes.\n\nThrough a combination of traditional and digital techniques, I create pieces that question the authenticity of our experience with nature in an age where such experiences are often mediated through screens and interfaces. I'm drawn to the ironies and contradictions that emerge when technology attempts to simulate or improve upon the natural world.\n\nBy juxtaposing organic materials with digital processes, my work invites viewers to reconsider their own connection to the physical environment and to reflect on what might be lost or gained as we increasingly inhabit virtual spaces. I seek to create moments of pauseâ€”spaces for contemplation about our place within both natural and constructed ecosystems.",
