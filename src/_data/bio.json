  "bioContent": "Amie Holstein is a painter and collage artist whose work explores themes of *consumption, clutter, and everyday life*. Through depictions of food, people, and domestic objects, she captures the overlooked moments that shape our routines and relationships. Her expressive, fast-paced process embraces imperfection, using scraps, bold colors, and gestural mark-making to reflect the chaos and stillness found in ordinary spaces.\n\nAmie’s work often feels visually overwhelming—dense, messy, and immediate—but it invites a slower look. She magnifies the mundane: dirty dishes, discarded packaging, unmade beds. These images are not cleaned up or idealized, but shown as they are—lived-in, imperfect, and real. Her art becomes a space for reflection, asking viewers to reconsider what we throw away, what we hold onto, and how everyday scenes shape our shared experience.",
