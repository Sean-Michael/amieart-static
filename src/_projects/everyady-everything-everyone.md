## Artist Statement

**Through painting and collage, I explore themes of consumption, connection, and clutter by capturing scenes from everyday life. My work is deeply influenced by the complex interplay between people and their environments — how our perceptions and experiences are shaped by the things we use, consume, and discard, and the remnants they leave behind.** 

**I am captivated by the inherent chaos of our daily routines. I find beauty in the small, often overlooked moments—unexpected and unremarkable: dirty dishes, empty coffee cups, a dumpster full of trash, messy floors. These candid moments hold quiet meaning. Through expressive mark-making and bold colors, I slow them down, transforming the mundane into something meaningful. The messy, the imperfect, the chaotic—these are not distractions or obstacles to overcome, but opportunities for introspection.**

**My process is intuitive, driven by the spontaneity and unpredictability of painting. The works themselves become an extension of this process, reflecting how I engage with the world around me. Through these reflections, I invite you to consider your own experiences, to recognize how the things you consume shape you, and to find connection in the messiness of life. Embrace the spills, the clutter, the chaotic, and the mundane.**
