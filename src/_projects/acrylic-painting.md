title: Acrylic Painting
description: "I use acrylic paint for its versatility and fast-drying qualities,
  which allow me to work quickly and intuitively. This medium lets me layer,
  revise, and respond to the painting in real time, capturing energy and
  spontaneity in each piece. I focus primarily on portraiture and everyday
  objects, using bold color and dynamic brushwork. "
