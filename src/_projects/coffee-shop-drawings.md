title: Coffee Shop Drawings
description: This series of drawings was inspired by the quiet energy and
  everyday beauty of coffee shops. When I travel, I make it a point to visit a
  new coffee shop in each place, using drawing as a way to explore and connect
  with the new place. I sketched many of these scenes on location, letting the
  atmosphere guide the composition. These works celebrate the small rituals of
  daily life and the comforting rhythm of unfamiliar and places.
